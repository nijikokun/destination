Default is `field`.\n    - `message` - Error message.\n\n```javascript\nValidator.implement(\"field\", function (options) {\n  if (options.data) {\n    options.error(\"Data exists, this is wrong... or right! I don't know!\");\n  }\n\n  // If you couldn't tell this gives an error back to the validator\n  options.error(\"No check has been done against this key!\");\n\n  // and you can set custom field name for the error message object\n  options.error(\"error-field\", \"This field hasn't been checked yet!\");\n});\n```\n\nAfter your implementation has been ran, the validator will check for errors, if found it will exit out and return the errors. You can pass along multiple errors per run, for an example check the test implementation.\n\n### Todo\n\n- ~~Make extensibility easier.~~\n- ~~Move over to github repository.~~\n- ~~Make implementations use an object as an argument rather than multiple arguments.~~\n- Implement nesting feature. Might be useful, I personally can't see one... let me know in issues if you can.\n- Break up implementations into their own folder and make a compiler.\n\nFuturistic / Unfeasible\n- Find a way to show how to do unique without requiring hassle of setup. (JuggleDB?)\n  - Essentially you connect in your database and get the collection and check against the key.\n  - It's not that hard but there are thousands of databases and ways people do things...\n\n### Changelog\n\nVersion 3.2.1\n  - Implemented `default` field.\n    - Supported even on `required` fields, may be subject to change. Let me know in issues how you feel.\n\nVersion 3.2\n  - Fixed test, now can be run with node\n  - Fixed length for Numbers with extended support for Arrays\n  - Fixed loop issue where only one value was returned\n  - Implemented support for natives no longer need to use strings for types\n    - `Function`, `String`... are supported, check password.type in test for more information.\n  - Implemented `debug` feature for showing value of fields along with error messages.\n  - Simplified roundup.\n\nVersion 3.1\n  - Extended comments\n  - Implemented module exporting for various platforms.\n\nVersion 3\n  - Remove console logging\n  - Implement plugin system - `.implement` method\n\nVersion 2\n - Fix slight bugs in matching validation check\n - Make errors Object based for quick key referencing\n\nVersion 1\n - Initial Release.\n",
