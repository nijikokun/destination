Install it using:\n\n\tnpm install extlog\n\nHow does it work?\n-----\n\nFirst you have to require the library:\n\n\tExtLog = require(\"extlog\");\n\nThen you can create instances:\n\n\tvar logHttp = new ExtLog(\"http\", \"cyan\");\n\tvar logDB = new ExtLog(\"database\", \"green\");\n\tvar logFS = new ExtLog(\"fs\", \"magenta\");\n\t\nYou create instances to know who is logging. So the code that handles the http server will log using logHttp, etc. ExtLog takes 2 arguments: the name and the color (red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, black or white). The name must be less than 9 characters.\n\nIn your code you can log:\n\n\tlogHttp.info(\"Hello World\");\n\tlogDB.debug(\"Logging a string:\", \"A string...\");\n\tlogFS.warning(\"Or a JSON object:\", {a:true, b:\"string\", c:null, d:91});\n\nThere are 5 different levels: debug, info, warning, error and fatal. The functions have 1 required argument and 1 optional.\n\nYou can also use counters:\n\t\n\tcountRequests = logHttp.getCounter(\"Requests per second\", 1000) // 1000ms = 1 second\n\tcountRequests.add();\n\tcountRequests.add();\n\tcountRequests.add();\n\t\n\tsetTimeout(function() {\n\t\tcountRequests.add();\n\t}, 2000);\n\t\nThe counter will log the number of times add() is called in the time (in this example 1 second). It won't log if add() isn't called in the second.\n\nIt'll look like this:\n\n![Screenshot 1](https://raw.github.com/ivogabe/extLog/master/screenshots/screen1.png \"Screenshot 1\")\n\nor\n\n![Screenshot 2](https://raw.github.com/ivogabe/extLog/master/screenshots/screen2.png \"Screenshot 2\")\n\nUsing typescript?\n------\nThere is a definition file included, so you can use this in your TypeScript project.\n\n\t/// <reference path=\"node_modules/extlog/console.d.ts\" />\n\timport ExtLog = require(\"ExtLog\");\n\t\n\tvar logDB : ExtLog = new ExtLog(\"database\", \"green\");\n\nMore options\n------\nYou can hide messages. For example, you only want to see the warnings, errors, and fatal errors.\n\n\tExtLog.setMinLevel(\"warning\");\n\t\nsetMinLevel takes one argument, a string. Enter the minimum level. This level and the levels above will be visible in the console. The levels are debug, info, counter, warning, error and fatal.\n\nYou can also set a minimum level for one instance, e.g. only for the database:\n\n\tlogDB.setMinLevel(\"warning\");\n\nThis way you can also get only logs from one instance:\n\n\tExtLog.setMinLevel(\"fatal\");\n\tlogDB.setMinLevel(\"debug\");\n\nRemember to call setMinLevel before logging!\n\nThe default logging function is console.log, but you can change it:\n\n\tExtLog.nativeFunction = function(str) {} // a global log function\n\tlogDB.nativeFunction = function(str) {} // a log function only for the database.\n\nLicense\n------\nExtLog is licensed under the MIT license.\n\nCopyright (C) 2013 Ivo Gabe de Wolff\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
